                Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development

            <p>Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made.</p>
